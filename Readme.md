# AVL Tree Visualization

This project provides an interactive visualization of AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) trees using JavaScript and HTML. The D3 library is employed for creating dynamic SVG elements and managing smooth animations.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.
   
2. **Run the Application:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. **Input Nodes:**
   - Enter a list of space-separated numbers into the "Enter nodes" input field.

2. **Insert Nodes:**
   - Click the "Insert Nodes" button to animate the insertion of nodes into the AVL tree.

3. **Visualization:**
   - The visualization dynamically displays the AVL tree structure with rotations highlighted.

4. **Reset:**
   - Use the "Reset" button to clear the tree and start over.

## Dependencies
